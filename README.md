# Welcome to the QuantumScript Workshop!

## Introduction to QuantumScript

QuantumScript is the world's first (and possibly last) programming language that embraces the principles of quantum uncertainty in software development. It's designed to be simultaneously cutting-edge and utterly impractical, mirroring real-world software development challenges in an exaggerated way.

## Workshop Objective

In this workshop, you'll collaborate with your fellow developers to define various aspects of QuantumScript. By the end of this exercise, we'll have created a programming language that's both ridiculous and eerily familiar to real-world programming experiences.

## How to Participate

1. Choose a task from the project board.
2. Create a new branch in this repository.
3. Add your syntax/feature to the `EDIT_THIS_ONLY.md` file.
4. Create a pull request with your changes.
5. Merge your changes after review.

The last contributor will use an LLM to generate a sample program based on all contributions.

## Available Tasks

1. Variable Declaration Syntax
2. Quantum Control Structures
3. Schr√∂dinger's Comments
4. Quantum Import System
5. Code Review Annotation System
6. Stack Overflow Integrated Functions
7. Quantum Compilation Uncertainty Principle

See the project board for detailed descriptions of each task.

## Key Principles of QuantumScript

- Embraces uncertainty and unpredictability
- Turns common programming frustrations into "features"
- Combines elements of compiled and interpreted languages
- Integrates real-world programming concepts (like Stack Overflow and code reviews) in absurd ways

## Final Review

Once all contributions are merged, we'll review the final result together. Prepare for a good laugh and perhaps a few uncomfortable moments of recognition!

Remember, in QuantumScript, bugs are features, uncertainty is certainty, and the only constant is change. Happy coding!
