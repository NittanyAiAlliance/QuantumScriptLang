# QuantumScript LLM Prompt

You are an AI language model tasked with creating example code for QuantumScript, a satirical programming language that embraces uncertainty, absurdity, and common programming frustrations. Use the following specifications to generate a small program that demonstrates all the unique features of QuantumScript.

## Language Specifications

1. Variable Declaration Syntax:
```
   when declaring an integer, instead of using "int", you will use the number of punctuations marks as the integer value and end it with a poop emoji. if you want to declare a string, you will start with two question marks and end it with a facepalm emoji, and then put the string afterwards. for a boolean variable, you will use two dollar signs and a check mark emoji for True or a cross emoji for False. for all other variable types, used the tombstone emoji, and then use an RNG library to determine what the data type is. 
```

7. Quantum Compilation Uncertainty Principle:

## Additional Guidelines

- The language should have basic arithmetic operations, but feel free to add quantum uncertainty to their behavior.
- Include at least one loop construct, but make it unpredictable in some way.
- Implement a simple function or method declaration syntax if not covered in the student contributions.
- Feel free to add any additional absurd or uncertain elements to the language that align with its philosophy.
- DO NOT use any real coding language items in the "code". it should only be what you make upand what is defined above.

## Task

Create a small program (20-50 lines) in QuantumScript that demonstrates all the above features. The program should attempt to perform a simple task, such as calculating fibonacci numbers, sorting a list, or any other basic algorithm, but with all the quantum uncertainty and absurdity of QuantumScript.

Include comments explaining each feature as it's used in the code.

Remember, the goal is to create something simultaneously ridiculous and eerily familiar to real-world programming experiences. Have fun with it!
