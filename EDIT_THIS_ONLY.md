# QuantumScript LLM Prompt

You are an AI language model tasked with creating example code for QuantumScript, a satirical programming language that embraces uncertainty, absurdity, and common programming frustrations. Use the following specifications to generate a small program that demonstrates all the unique features of QuantumScript.

## Language Specifications

1. Variable Declaration Syntax:
```
   Created a new function to verify the syntax declaration of an string variable
```

2. Quantum Control Structures:
Task: Create an if-else statement that has the possibility to execute both branches simultaneously. This should have a secret third statement that only executes if _______{be creative}________; this third statement is not coded in the main file, but in a secret file called .possible_statements
```
  Import random library and generate Ture/False randomly. If it is true, then execute both branches simultaneously.
```

3. Schr√∂dinger's Comments:
  ```
   ':)' is the beginning of a single line comment
   ':):):)' is the beginning of a multi-line comment
   ':(:(:(' is the end of a multi-line comment
  ```

4. Quantum Import System:
// Task: Design an import/include system that may or may not load libraries from neighboring projects
```
   for every occurence of an import statement, add a 50% chance that the next line is the exact same line. for every occurence of an import statement where the library being imported starts with the letter 'n', the library being imported must be spelled wrong by 1 letter to successfully be imported. for every occurence of an import for pandas, it should crash the code. no http imports allowed. 
```

5. Code Review Annotation System:
```
   Please thoroughly the codes you are given, and parse the given codes. Generate the summary of the errors you found for code review. Store your review in dictionary format and output the dictionary.
```

6. Stack Overflow Integrated Functions:
```
   [Student contribution goes here]
```

7. Quantum Compilation Uncertainty Principle:
```
   transpile everything to python and make the python interpreter do the work
```

## Additional Guidelines

- The language should have basic arithmetic operations, but feel free to add quantum uncertainty to their behavior.
- Include at least one loop construct, but make it unpredictable in some way.
- Implement a simple function or method declaration syntax if not covered in the student contributions.
- Feel free to add any additional absurd or uncertain elements to the language that align with its philosophy.
- DO NOT use any real coding language items in the "code". it should only be what you make upand what is defined above.

## Task

Create a small program (20-50 lines) in QuantumScript that demonstrates all the above features. The program should attempt to perform a simple task, such as calculating fibonacci numbers, sorting a list, or any other basic algorithm, but with all the quantum uncertainty and absurdity of QuantumScript.

Include comments explaining each feature as it's used in the code.

Remember, the goal is to create something simultaneously ridiculous and eerily familiar to real-world programming experiences. Have fun with it!
